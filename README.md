  ## Description
  My task was to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so writing a unit test for every part of my code to ensure that it passes each test.

  ## Installation
  To generate your own README, first run `npm i` in order to install the dependencies. The application itself can be invoked with `node index.js`.

  ## Usage
  ![Gif demo of team-profile-generator](./Assets/walk-through.gif)
  
  When you run `node index.js`, the application uses the `inquirer` package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions.

  The application then takes your response and will generate populate the `team.html` file in the folder output. 

  Once this is done, open your `team.html` in your web broswer and you can see your team members!
